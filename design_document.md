# AI-Integrated Screenwriting Tool – Design Document

## 1 Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an **open‑source, cross‑platform screenwriting tool** that replicates and extends the key capabilities of Final Draft 13 while adding **AI‑assisted features**.  The product will help writers plan, draft and revise stories while receiving real‑time, context‑aware suggestions from a large‑language model (LLM).  Unlike proprietary software, the tool will use open formats and a modular architecture so that contributors can extend it.

## 2 Final Draft 13 Feature Summary

Final Draft 13 provides a rich set of planning, drafting and collaboration tools.  Key features relevant to this design include:

* **Planning tools** – Final Draft offers a **Beat Board™, Outline Editor™ and Structure Lines** so writers can brainstorm, visualize and outline stories.  These tools allow writers to plan for any kind of storytelling by creating beats, organizing them into lanes and using color‑coded structure lines【787492058770364†L65-L70】【77232393744955†L90-L115】.
* **Smart writing tools** – SmartType offers **auto‑completion of locations and character names** and stores multiple versions of dialogue【787492058770364†L74-L79】.  Automatic formatting guarantees **industry‑standard screenplay layout**【787492058770364†L96-L99】.
* **Customizable workspace** – Writers can choose different view modes such as **Typewriter view** that centers the active line【77232393744955†L123-L127】 and **dark/Midnight modes** to reduce eyestrain【77232393744955†L135-L138】.  The Navigator 2.0 lets users outline directly, edit scene headings and even monitor inclusivity statistics【478922719946738†L82-L98】.
* **Revision and production tools** – Track changes lets writers revise with comments【787492058770364†L103-L106】.  Revision mode supports locking pages, omitting scenes and marking changes【787492058770364†L275-L300】.  Production features include tagging props/wardrobe for scheduling and budgeting and generating reports【787492058770364†L275-L292】.
* **Real‑time collaboration** – Writers can collaborate simultaneously on both the script and the Beat Board【787492058770364†L109-L113】【77232393744955†L157-L162】.
* **Other productivity tools** – Focus mode helps eliminate distractions【77232393744955†L171-L174】, while Sprint Timer and writing goals provide productivity stats【787492058770364†L143-L153】【77232393744955†L140-L144】.  Final Draft also supports PDF import/export【787492058770364†L137-L139】【77232393744955†L164-L169】 and autosaves work【787492058770364†L131-L134】.
* **Character tools** – The Navigator 2.0 (characters) tracks character screen time, interactions and can assign voices to read the script back【478922719946738†L94-L99】【77232393744955†L151-L155】.

These features provide a high bar for the open‑source project; the design must offer similar planning and drafting capabilities while remaining extensible.

## 3 Design Goals and Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

1. **Script Editor** – Provide a distraction‑free editor with automatic screenplay formatting.  The editor should recognize scene headings, character names and dialogue (similar to Final Draft’s SmartType【787492058770364†L74-L79】【688434658925940†L121-L132】).  It must support typewriter mode and dark themes【77232393744955†L123-L127】【77232393744955†L135-L138】.
2. **Beat Board and Outline Editor** – Implement an interactive canvas where users can create, label and arrange beats.  Support multi‑lane outlining and flow lines that connect beats to illustrate story flow【77232393744955†L90-L115】【77232393744955†L184-L188】.  Beats should be draggable and color‑coded with structure lines【478922719946738†L102-L119】.
3. **ScriptNotes and Annotations** – Allow writers to add notes that can be shown/hidden in the script and beat board.  Notes should be customizable and attachable to scenes or beats【77232393744955†L99-L103】.
4. **Versioning & Revision** – Maintain version history, track changes and support revision mode (locking pages, marking edits)【787492058770364†L275-L300】.  Provide PDF export with revision marks and color versions.
5. **Real‑time Collaboration** – Enable multiple users to edit scripts and beats simultaneously with conflict resolution.  Provide user presence and chat.
6. **Writing Metrics and Goals** – Include a sprint timer, goals, writing streaks and productivity stats【787492058770364†L143-L153】【77232393744955†L140-L144】.  Provide analytics such as average scene length and dialogue statistics【688434658925940†L150-L154】.
7. **Production Tools** – Allow tagging of props, wardrobe and locations for scheduling and budgeting【787492058770364†L275-L292】.  Generate reports of characters, locations, scenes and revisions for pre‑production.
8. **Import/Export** – Support importing from PDF and Final Draft (FDX) formats and exporting to PDF, FDX and open‑source Fountain format【787492058770364†L137-L139】【688434658925940†L185-L186】.
9. **Plugin Architecture** – Provide a plugin framework so developers can extend the tool with features (similar to Beat’s plugin system【688434658925940†L157-L160】).

### 3.2 AI‑Assisted Requirements

1. **Context‑aware Suggestions** – The AI must maintain awareness of the current story context, including plot arcs, character relationships and tone.  It will suggest potential dialogue completions, scene summaries or structural changes.
2. **Story Analysis** – Provide feedback on pacing, act structure and character arcs.  Highlight unused characters, identify long scenes and suggest where beats might be added or merged.  Offer inclusivity statistics similar to Final Draft’s inclusivity stats【478922719946738†L82-L98】.
3. **Language & Grammar** – Suggest grammar improvements, ensure consistent tense and voice and offer alternative phrasings.  Integration with grammar‑checking tools like LanguageTool or open‑source models can complement the LLM.
4. **Personalization** – Allow users to enable/disable AI suggestions and to choose between on‑device models (for privacy) or remote models (for higher quality).  Support fine‑tuning with user feedback.

### 3.3 Non‑Functional Requirements

1. **Open‑Source & Extensibility** – Use permissive licenses (e.g., MIT or GPL) and open data formats (Fountain, JSON).  The architecture should encourage community contributions.
2. **Cross‑Platform** – Support Windows, macOS and Linux via Electron or Tauri.  A web version can share code with the desktop build.
3. **Scalability & Reliability** – Real‑time collaboration must handle multiple concurrent users.  Autosave and offline support are essential.
4. **Security & Privacy** – All user data should be stored securely.  For AI features, sensitive content must not be sent to external services without user consent.

## 4 System Architecture

### 4.1 Overview

The proposed system consists of three main layers:

1. **Front‑end Client (Electron/Tauri & React)** – Implements the user interface: script editor, beat board, outline editor, sprint timer and dashboards.  Uses React for UI, Slate or ProseMirror for rich‑text editing and React‑Flow for the beat board.  The client communicates with the collaboration and AI services via WebSocket and REST.
2. **Collaboration & API Server (Node.js/Express)** – Hosts REST and WebSocket endpoints.  It stores projects, user accounts, revisions and metadata in a PostgreSQL database.  It handles authentication, version control, tagging and generates production reports.  Real‑time collaboration uses a Conflict‑free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) library (e.g., **Yjs** or **Automerge**) to synchronize edits between clients.
3. **AI Service (Python FastAPI)** – Exposes endpoints for context management, suggestion generation and story analysis.  It integrates with large‑language models (e.g., OpenAI GPT or open‑source Llama‑2) and summarization libraries.  The AI service maintains a vector store of script embeddings to answer context‑aware queries.

```
+------------+    WebSocket    +--------------------+    gRPC/REST     +--------------+
|  Front‑end | <--------------> | Collaboration/API  | <-------------> |  AI Service  |
+------------+                 +--------------------+                 +--------------+
       ^                                                                    ^
       |         REST, file upload/download (imports/exports)              |
       |                                                                    |
    PostgreSQL DB <-------------- persistent storage ------------------------
```

### 4.2 Modules

1. **Script Editor Module** – Implements the screenplay editor with automatic formatting.  It uses a schema to identify scene headings, action lines and dialogue.  The module interacts with the collaboration layer to sync changes and stores user settings.
2. **Beat Board Module** – A canvas where beats are cards containing title, description, color, and links to other beats.  Users can drag & drop cards, draw flow lines and assign structure colors【77232393744955†L184-L188】.  The beat board data is synced across clients via CRDT.
3. **Outline Editor** – Provides a hierarchical view of beats/scenes and supports adding customizable lanes【77232393744955†L90-L115】.  Scenes can be reorganized and collapsed.
4. **Notes & Tagging Module** – Allows creation of ScriptNotes and production tags.  Notes can be attached to scenes or beats and toggled on/off【77232393744955†L99-L103】.  Tags facilitate generating prop/wardrobe reports【787492058770364†L275-L292】.
5. **Revision & History Module** – Maintains a history of changes, supports revision colors and page locks.  Writers can accept/reject changes and compare versions【787492058770364†L275-L300】.
6. **Collaboration Module** – Implements real‑time editing with CRDTs.  Provides user presence indicators and chat.  It manages sessions, permissions and conflict resolution【787492058770364†L109-L113】【77232393744955†L157-L162】.
7. **Analytics & Productivity Module** – Tracks writing time, word counts, scene lengths and character statistics (similar to Beat’s statistics【688434658925940†L150-L154】).  Implements sprint timer and goals【787492058770364†L143-L153】.
8. **Import/Export Module** – Parses and converts between FDX, Fountain and PDF.  Uses third‑party libraries for PDF import and exports revision‑colored PDFs【787492058770364†L137-L139】【77232393744955†L146-L149】.
9. **Plugin System** – Loads external plugins written in JavaScript/TypeScript.  Plugins can add UI panels, integrate AI features or import/export formats (similar to Beat’s plugin system【688434658925940†L157-L160】).
10. **AI Module** – Provides functions for context summarization, dialogue suggestions, story analysis and style feedback.  Maintains an internal representation of the script, including character maps and plot arcs.  It queries an LLM and returns suggestions with confidence scores.

### 4.3 Data Models

- **Script Document** – stored as a CRDT (Y.Doc) containing sequences of scene objects.  Each scene object holds metadata (scene heading, characters, time of day, location, synopsis), dialogue lines and associated notes.
- **Beat** – object with `id`, `title`, `description`, `color`, `lane`, `links` (for flow lines), `order`, and optional `tags` or `attachments`.
- **Revision Entry** – links a script snapshot to a revision identifier, change log and color.  Tracks author and timestamp.
- **User Profile** – stores preferences (themes, keybindings), writing goals and statistics.
- **AI Context** – stores embeddings of scenes and beats, summarizations, and analysis results per project.

## 5 AI Integration Strategy

1. **Context Management** – When a user is writing, the front‑end sends the current scene and several preceding scenes to the AI service.  The service retrieves vector embeddings from the context store and generates a summary of the story so far.  It also keeps track of characters and plot threads to avoid inconsistency.
2. **Dialogue Auto‑Completion** – As the writer begins a dialogue line, the AI service predicts potential completions.  It uses the character’s voice and past dialogues to generate suggestions.  The front‑end displays these suggestions inline and allows insertion or dismissal.
3. **Story Analysis & Feedback** – On demand, the AI service analyzes pacing (scene lengths), act structure, character arcs and inclusivity metrics【478922719946738†L82-L98】【688434658925940†L150-L154】.  It flags anomalies (e.g., an underused character) and suggests adding or trimming scenes or beats.
4. **Model Choices** – For privacy, the system supports local models (e.g., LLaMA 2 or Mistral) running in the AI service.  For better quality or resource‑constrained users, a remote API (OpenAI) can be configured via environment variables.
5. **Human‑in‑the‑Loop** – AI suggestions are always optional; users must explicitly insert or accept them.  The tool records accepted suggestions to fine‑tune the model in future releases.

## 6 Development Plan

The project will be developed incrementally to deliver usable features early while allowing contributors to join.  Below is a suggested phase plan:

   - Write documentation for plugin development.

10. **Testing, Documentation & Release (Weeks 18‑20)**
    - Write unit and integration tests.  Conduct usability testing with writers.
    - Complete user documentation, API docs and developer guidelines.  Publish release candidates and gather feedback.

## 7 Risks & Mitigations

- **AI Hallucinations** – The LLM may generate inconsistent or irrelevant suggestions.  Mitigation: present suggestions as optional, use summarization and retrieval augmentation, and allow users to provide feedback.
- **Resource Requirements** – Running local models may require significant memory.  Mitigation: support remote APIs and allow model selection based on capability.
- **Complexity of Collaboration** – Real‑time editing and conflict resolution is challenging.  Mitigation: use proven CRDT libraries (Yjs/Automerge) and incremental rollout.
- **Licensing & Legal** – Using models and fonts must comply with licenses.  Mitigation: choose permissive licenses for dependencies and clearly document any proprietary integration.

## 8 Conclusion

This design document outlines an open‑source screenwriting application inspired by Final Draft 13.  By replicating core planning and drafting features—including a beat board, outline editor, real‑time collaboration, revision mode and production tools—and layering on AI‑assisted story analysis and dialogue suggestions, the project aims to democratize professional screenwriting tools.  The modular architecture, open formats and plugin system will foster community contributions and allow continuous evolution.
