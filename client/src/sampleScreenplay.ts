EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A quaint neighborhood coffee shop bustles with morning activity. Steam rises from espresso machines as PATRONS chat over their morning brew.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The warm interior is filled with the aroma of fresh coffee. Vintage posters line exposed brick walls.

SARAH (28), an aspiring screenwriter with tired eyes and coffee-stained fingers, hunches over her laptop at a corner table. Empty coffee cups form a small fortress around her workspace.

JOHN (30), charming but disheveled, approaches with two fresh cups of coffee.

JOHN
(setting down the cups)
Thought you could use a refill. You've been at it since dawn.

SARAH
(not looking up)
Thanks. Just need to finish this scene.

JOHN
The one where the hero realizes the truth?

Sarah finally looks up, a slight smile breaking through her concentration.

SARAH
How did you know?

JOHN
(grinning)
Lucky guess. Plus, you always get that look when you're writing the big revelation.

Sarah stretches, her joints protesting from hours of hunching.

SARAH
I can't get the dialogue right. It feels too... obvious.

JOHN
(sitting down)
Sometimes obvious is what the audience needs. Not everything has to be a puzzle.

SARAH
(sighs)
But it needs to feel earned. The character has been through so much to get here.

JOHN
Then let them feel it. Let them struggle with the words.

Sarah considers this, then turns back to her laptop with renewed focus.

SARAH
(typing)
You might be onto something.

JOHN
I'll leave you to it. But Sarah?

She looks up.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Don't forget to save your work. And maybe eat something?

SARAH
(smiling)
Yes, mom.

John laughs and heads back to the counter. Sarah returns to her screen, fingers flying across the keyboard with new inspiration.

FADE TO:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

The sun has moved across the sky. Through the window, we see Sarah still writing, but now with a satisfied expression.

FADE OUT.

THE END`;
