# Final Draft 13 Typing Behavior and Navigation Guide

Final Draft 13's typing behavior follows a sophisticated system designed to streamline screenplay writing through intelligent keyboard navigation and automatic formatting. Here's the complete keystroke-by-keystroke behavior as you type a screenplay.

## Starting with "FADE IN:" - The Opening Transition

When beginning a screenplay, typing "FADE IN:" demonstrates Final Draft's automatic formatting system. As you type these characters, the software recognizes it as a transition element. **Transitions automatically format to ALL CAPS and align to 6.0 inches from the left edge** (flush right with the right margin). After typing "FADE IN:" and pressing Enter, the cursor automatically moves to create an Action element, properly positioned at the left margin (1.5 inches from page edge).

## Scene Heading Navigation - The Tab Key is Critical

The scene heading workflow showcases Final Draft 13's most distinctive typing behavior. **The Tab key, not Enter, is essential for proper scene heading navigation**.

When you type "I" or "E" at the beginning of a line, SmartType immediately activates, displaying a dropdown with "INT.", "EXT.", and "I/E" options. Pressing **Tab accepts the selection and automatically adds a period and space**. The cursor is now positioned for the location.

As you type the location (e.g., "RESTAURANT"), Final Draft **automatically capitalizes every letter**. Pressing Tab again adds **space-dash-space (" - ")** and positions the cursor for the time element. Typing "D" triggers SmartType to suggest "DAY", "NIGHT", and other time options. Tab accepts the selection.

**Critical behavior**: If you press Enter within a scene heading instead of Tab, the software creates a new line rather than properly formatting the heading structure - a common mistake for new users.

## Action Line Behavior and Formatting

After completing a scene heading with Enter, Final Draft automatically creates an Action element. The cursor positions at **1.5 inches from the left edge** (flush with the left margin), with the right margin at approximately **7.5 inches**.

Action lines maintain sentence case - Final Draft doesn't auto-capitalize these. The software preserves your exact capitalization choices, allowing you to manually capitalize important props, sounds, or character introductions per screenplay conventions.

Pressing Enter creates a new Action paragraph. **Pressing Enter twice opens the element dropdown menu**, allowing quick element switching without using menus or keyboard shortcuts.

## Character Name Positioning and SmartType

Moving from Action to Character demonstrates Final Draft's intelligent element transitions. After Action text, pressing Enter twice and selecting "Character" (or using Cmd/Ctrl+3) positions the cursor at **3.7 inches from the left page edge**.

As you type a character name, several things happen simultaneously:
- The text automatically formats to ALL CAPS
- SmartType stores the name for future use
- Previously used character names appear in a dropdown as you type

Pressing Enter from a Character element automatically creates a Dialogue element with proper indentation.

## Dialogue Indentation and Flow

The Dialogue element showcases precise formatting control. The cursor positions at **2.5 inches from the left page edge** with a right margin at approximately **6.0-6.5 inches**, creating a dialogue column of 3.5-3.7 inches wide - the industry standard.

Within dialogue, pressing Enter continues the dialogue on a new line within the same element. To exit dialogue, pressing Enter moves to Action by default, though this behavior is customizable through Format > Elements settings.

## Parenthetical Behavior and Positioning

Parentheticals demonstrate context-sensitive Tab behavior. While in a Character element, pressing Tab creates a parenthetical instead of moving to dialogue. The parenthetical positions at **3.1 inches from the left edge**, with automatic parentheses insertion.

Common parenthetical uses include character directions "(quietly)", position indicators "(O.S.)" for off-screen, or "(V.O.)" for voice-over. After typing the parenthetical content, pressing Enter moves to Dialogue.

## SmartType System During Typing

Throughout typing, SmartType actively assists with several behaviors:
- **Predictive dropdowns** appear after typing the first letter(s) of recognized elements
- **Auto-completion** narrows choices as you continue typing
- **New entries** automatically add to SmartType lists for future use
- **Frequency tracking** allows reordering lists based on usage patterns

The system maintains separate lists for Characters, Locations, Times, Transitions, and Character Extensions, all accessible through Document > SmartType.

## Automatic Formatting Rules

Final Draft 13 applies these automatic formatting rules as you type:

**Automatic Capitalization**:
- Scene headings: INT./EXT., locations, and times
- Character names: Always ALL CAPS
- Transitions: ALL CAPS with colon
- First word of new sentences (optional setting)

**Format Recognition**:
- Typing "int." or "ext." at the start of an Action line auto-converts to Scene Heading
- Typing recognized transition phrases triggers transition formatting
- Character names followed by dialogue maintain proper spacing

## Page Break Management

The software handles page breaks intelligently:
- Dialogue spanning pages automatically adds "(MORE)" at bottom and "CHARACTER (CONT'D)" at top
- Scene headings won't orphan at page bottoms
- Character names move to next page if dialogue would split
- **Widow/orphan protection** keeps character names with their dialogue

## Customizable Element Transitions

The default typing flow follows: Scene Heading → Action → Character → Dialogue → Action. However, Format > Elements allows complete customization. Many writers modify the Dialogue → Character transition for rapid dialogue scenes, eliminating the need to return to Action between speakers.

## Tab vs Enter Key Summary

Understanding when to use Tab versus Enter is crucial:

**Use Tab for**:
- Moving through scene heading components
- Creating parentheticals from Character elements
- Accepting SmartType suggestions
- Navigating within structured elements

**Use Enter for**:
- Completing elements and moving to the next
- Creating new paragraphs within Action
- Moving from Character to Dialogue
- Triggering element selection (double Enter)

## Technical Precision

Final Draft 13 maintains these exact measurements:
- **12-point Courier font** (industry standard)
- **55 lines per page** with proper formatting
- **1 page ≈ 1 minute** screen time when properly formatted
- All margins and indentations conform to Writers Guild standards

This precise behavior ensures that every keystroke contributes to a professionally formatted screenplay, with the software handling technical requirements while writers focus on creative content.
